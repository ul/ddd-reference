# DDD Reference

A summary of the patterns and definitions of DDD, typeset in an arguably neater fashion than the [original PDF.](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD_Reference_2015-03.pdf)

Read it as a [PDF,](./ddd-reference.pdf) or refer to the `*.dj` files for the content in a Markdown-like lightweight markup. 

I tried to be faithful to the original document both in terms of content and emphasis, but mistakes are unavoidable, and correction PRs are welcome.
I took the liberty, however, of replacing "Therefore:" paragraphs with the ∴ symbol used as a horizontal divider.
